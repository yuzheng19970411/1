## Discussion
In the original example, Test Accuracy = 0.989. I'm trying to change some parameters.
*Through this learning, I have a general understanding of the convolutional neural network. Compared with the 93% accuracy rate of handwriting recognition of SVM, the CNN algorithm greatly reduces the amount of calculation and greatly improves its accuracy. In this case, the accuracy rate of the CNN algorithm can reach 98.9% through only 10 iterations of training. This reflects the advantages of the CNN algorithm and has more advantages for image recognition processing, which greatly expands the application range of the CNN algorithm.
