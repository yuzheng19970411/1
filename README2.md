## Discussion
In the original example, Test Accuracy = 0.989. I'm trying to change some parameters.

* To make the model have less cost and more accuracy, i change its weight to see if the result improves.I change the sigma value，Test Accuracy =0.988. Unfortunately, the results didn't get any better. The second time the value of sigma was changed to 0.05, and the Test Accuracy was 0.988, which was also not improved.

* padding: ‘SAME’ or ‘VALID’
